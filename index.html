    <h1>Banana Translator</h1>
    <p>Ever wondered how the minions in Despecable Me!! talked among themselves in a mumbo jumbo language.Well, turns out they talked in an actual language called the Banana Language or Minion Language.Here's a translator that does the same, it converts your messages in English to messages in Minion Language!!!.

    <textarea id="textArea" placeholder="Enter text here which is to be translated to the Minion's Language"></textarea>
    <br>
    <button id="translate">Translate to Banana!!!</button>
    <br>
    <span id="span-text1">Translated text will appear here 👇</span>

        <p>Wasn't it fun to now know that all those times we thought they were just ridiculously speaking they were actually making sense!! and how it would feel like if we try to speak something in their language too.</p>
